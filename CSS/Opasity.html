    <p> A 2014 study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that the more
        coffee participants drank, the less likely they were to develop malignant
        melanoma over a 10 year period. Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin
        cancer. Almost 450,000 whites, aged 50-71, participated in the study.
        Researchers found that drinking four or more cups of coffee per day was linked
        to a 20% lower risk of getting malignant melanoma. Once again, drinkers of
        decaffeinated coffee lost out. Their risk of getting melanoma was no different
        from that of non-coffee drinkers.</p>
